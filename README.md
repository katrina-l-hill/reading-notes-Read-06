JavaScript:
•	JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to take source code regarding text, colors, numbers, tables, maps, etc., and present them in a web page.
•	It can be thought of as using algebra-like code to create the aspects of the web page, such as numbers, strings, objects, functions, etc.
•	Like algebra, JavaScript uses variables and functions, which can be changed to suit your needs, to tell text and numbers what to do.

 
Conditionals:
•	Conditionals are based on a logic problem. Or they can be based on something else similar.
•	Essentially, they are used to check that a specific condition is met, and if not then it will describe the conditions necessary for the condition to be accurate or false.
 
Console = CLI
•	The console can be thought of as the command-line interface (CLI).
•	It is a tool used as part of the coding development process to log results, debug code, execute code.
•	You can access the console via F12 or right clicking in the page and selecting "Inspect."
